# Desktop RPC

Desktop RPC operations are requested by the adapter and executed by the desktop client. The desktop responds with the same `op` and the same `id`.

::: warning
Screenshots and window information may contain sensitive content. Adapters and upper-level plugins should use these capabilities only in user-authorized interaction flows.

## `desktop.tool.call`

`desktop.tool.call` is the generic desktop tool channel. The desktop declares available tools in `sys.handshake.payload.tools`, and the adapter can call them by declaration.

  "id": "tool-call-id",
  "ts": 1781240000000,
  "payload": {
    "tool": "capture_screenshot",
    "args": {
      "target": "active",
      "quality": 80
    }
  }
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "op": "desktop.tool.call",
  "id": "tool-call-id",
  "ts": 1781240000100,
  "payload": {
    "tool": "capture_screenshot",
    "result": {
      "image": "data:image/jpeg;base64,...",
      "width": 1280,
      "height": 720
    }
  }
}
```

Failures may use `error` inside the payload:

```json

  "op": "desktop.tool.call",
  "id": "tool-call-id",

    "error": "permission denied"
  }
